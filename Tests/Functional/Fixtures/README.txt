The AsteroidData* files are not used yet, as I could not think
of a good way to test BOM/no BOM with the current state of the
extension. However I have stored these files here for future
reference.

The files come from NASA data: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/asteroidfact.html
and were provided by Andrew Murphy. More details at: https://forge.typo3.org/issues/54778
